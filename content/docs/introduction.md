<p class="content">An energy efficient household, which has an idea about the future can optimize its consumption in the present, to preserve energy. This can be achieved by using machine learning methods, which are now commonly used in various industries everywhere, to make systems smart and study patterns invisible to the human eye. A smart home, integrated with these methods can save energy by itself, without the resident ever needing to constantly worry about the next day.</p>

<p class="content">This project will aim at achieving greater efficiency, increased reliability for sustaining a household. For this, the project will employ a data-driven approach calculating the power consumptions of each and every home appliance. It will prioritize the duration and time of usage of each appliance through self-learning algorithms in order to minimize and distribute the power requirements throughout the day while also ensuring user convenience. At the moments of peak requirements, some devices could be shut down if they are not immediately needed. For instance, the system will ensure minimum permissible lighting in case of peak power requirements and switch off the remaining lights. The temperature of the AC could be optimized automatically to an intermediate temperature level where the power consumptions are low so that load is minimized and user comfort is also ensured.</p>

<p class="content">To remove the entry barrier for customers to the smart-home market, novel Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled modules will be designed which will attach to a houseâ€™s existing commonly used electric appliances and connect these individual appliances with the local Home Automation System (HAS) network. These modules will be plug and play setup kits eliminating the need for replacing the pre-existing appliances and purchasing special smart devices. Drivers will be packaged in the firmware of the appliance which will be installed in the HAS during the initial configuration. A driver development framework will also be built which can be used by third party manufacturers, to integrate with the HAS.</p>

<p class="content">By promoting machine learning to compensate for the nonlinear interactions between household appliances and environment we can lower energy production costs by millions of dollars per annum. This will also increase the longevity of the energy storage systems used in renewable energy systems, by balancing the discharge and recharge cycles. Machine learning based predictive models will address frequently arising problems by load shifting, valley filling or peak clipping. Predicting the energy consumption is similar to lowering the distance between the actual and anticipated rates.</p>

<p class="content">Sensors around the house will monitor variables such as user presence, temperature and illumination, and turn on specific devices to increase convenience and ease of usage, according to predefined and self-evolving algorithms customized for an individual user.</p>

<p class="content">An application will be designed facilitating interaction of the user with the Home Automation Unit. This application will allow users to access each appliance through the HAS remotely using mobile phones and tablets over the cloud.</p>

<p class="content">Ultimately, everything will be designed with a modular design approach, allowing the users to pick and choose the selected functionality they want to add to their house, based on their personal requirements and monetary capability. The users will also be able to add functionality over an extended span of time, enhancing the viability of this project and long-term relevance of the project.</p>

<p class="content">In such a scenario, an individual is automatically the power manager of his/her domain but the effectiveness and efficiency of this option depends on the capability of the owners to maintain the facilities. The project will focus on installing increased number of appliances along with much longer time of operation by providing reliability on the consumption of energy.</p>
